Run qbittorrent rootless and distroless.

# INTRODUCTION üì¢

qBittorrent is a bittorrent client programmed in C++ / Qt that uses libtorrent (sometimes called libtorrent-rasterbar) by Arvid Norberg.

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will run qbittorrent [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md), for maximum security. Enjoy your adventures on the high sea as safe[^1] as it can be.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! Because ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* ... this image runs [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) as 1000:1000
>* ... this image has no shell since it is [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md)
>* ... this image is auto updated to the latest version via CI/CD
>* ... this image has a health check
>* ... this image runs read-only
>* ... this image is automatically scanned for CVEs before and after publishing
>* ... this image is created via a secure and pinned CI/CD process
>* ... this image verifies all external payloads
>* ... this image is very small

If you value security, simplicity and optimizations to the extreme, then this image might be for you.

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [5.1.2](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/qbittorrent/tags?name=5.1.2)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:5.1.2``` you can use ```:5``` or ```:5.1```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!
